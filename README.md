# Document Object Model: 
DOM parser is faster than SAX because it access whole XML document in memory.
Parsing XML file using DOM parser is quite fast if XML file is small but if you try to
read a large XML file using DOM parser there is more chances that it will take a long time

# Simple API parser:
Itâ€™s recommended to use SAX XML parser for parsing large XML files in Java
because it doesn't require to load whole XML file in Java and it can read a big XML file in small parts
